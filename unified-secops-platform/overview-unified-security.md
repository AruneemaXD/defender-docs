# What is the Microsoft unified security operations platform?

<!--Need to define when something goes here versus other what's new articles. Maybe we just focus on updates within this library and things tied directly to USX (features that unblock onboarding, parity features with Sentinel, enhancements to core USX features?) -->

Microsoft unified security operations provides a single platform for end-to-end security operations (SecOps). Within the platform, you can reduce risk and prevent attacks with integrated exposure management, detect and disrupt cyberthreats in real time, and investigate and respond faster with generative AI solutions that innovate and enhance security capabilities.

The unified security operations platform combines services in the [Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com). The portal provides a single location to monitor, detect, investigate, remediate, and respond against prebreach and postbreach cybersecurity risks and threats.


## Why adopt a unified SecOps platform?

### Protect assets

Use the unified security platform to protect a wide range of assets, including:


- Protect against threats posed by email messages, URL links, and Office 365 collaboration tools with Defender for Office 365.
- Monitor and protect endpoint devices with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. You can monitor, detect, and investigate device breaches, and automatically respond to security threats.
- With Defender Vulnerability Management, you can identify assets and software inventory, and assess device posture to find security vulnerabilities.
- Protect and control access to SaaS cloud apps with Defender for Cloud Apps.
- Identify, detect, and investigate Entra ID threats with Defender for Identity.
- Improve multicloud and on-premises security posture, and protect cloud workloads against threats with Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Discover and assess assets, and remediate risk to reduce attack surfaces with Microsoft Security Exposure Management.
- Identify and protect OT/IT resources by extending Defender XDR protection to OT environments with Microsoft Defender for IoT.

### Simplify security management

Use combined security services for end-to-end pre and post breach protection of endpoints, identities, cloud apps and workloads, and email across your organization.

The Defender portal provides a single, centralized view of organizational security posture and threat detections and response, and provides a combined incidents queue that groups together information security risks and breaches.

Free up analyst time as unified security dashboards enable analysts to cross organization silos, prioritize the most critical threats, and hunt effectively for attempted breaches.



### Reduce security risk and prevent attacks

Consistently reducing security risk and preventing cybersecurity attacks is an important part of your organizational risk management framework. The unified security operations platform offers comprehenive exposure management and cloud protection capabilities. With Microsoft Security Exposure Management, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud you can:

- Continuously discover organizational assets and asses their security posture.  
- Protect cloud workloads from code to runtime.
- Aggregate data and threat intelligence to discover security gaps and weaknesses, including analysis of potential attack paths.
- Investigate and query to get insights into security posture.
- Prioritize asset remediation, with focus on critical resources, to reduce security gaps and attack surfaces.

### Reduce threat detection and response times

Standard cybersecurity metrics focus on the time to detect (TTD) which measures how long it takes security teams to discover an incident, and time to respond (TTR) which measures the amount of time it takes to respond after a threat is detected. The shorter the TTD and TTR, the more effective your detection and response strategy is.

Microsoft's unified security platform correlates millions of signals from Defender products, Microsoft security research, and threat intelligence to identify attacks in progress. It initiates automatic attack disruption to automatically contain attacks, limiting lateral movement early, and reduce attack impact. Automatic attack disruption helps to reduce costs associated with loss of productivity, provide control to the SecOps team control to investigate and remediate compromised assets.

Automatic attack disruption responds to threats by containing devices and containing/disabling users to mitigate attacks.

## Transform SOC productivity

Microsoft Security Copilot brings together the power of AI and human expertise to help your SOC team respond to attacks faster and more effectively. Security Copilot is embedded in the Defender portal to enable security teams to efficiently summarize incidents, analyze scripts and codes, analyze files, summarize device information, use guided responses to resolve incidents, generate KQL queries, and create incident reports. Security Copilot helps you to:

- **Reduce exposure and improve posture**. Prevent breaches with insights to uncover critical exposure risk, and risk reduction recommendations.
- **Prevent and disrupt threats**. Identify and prioritize with incident summaries MITRE ATT&CK framework mapping, and automatic alert enrichment.
- **Empower analysts**:
    - Accelerate incident resolution with guided responses, automated remediation, and summary report generation.
    - Provide intelligent assistance provides tailored prompts based on best practices, that analyze malicious scripts and files, and suggest KQL queries.
