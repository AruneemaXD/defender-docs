# Defender portal

Microsoft's unified security platform combines services in the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com). Use the Defender portal to monitor and manage pre-breach and post-breach security across on-premises and multicloud assets and workloads. The portal provides quick, centralized access to the state of security across the organization, consolidating security data and context for easy viewing and deep analysis. 

Microsoft services in the Defender portal include.

- Visualize and monitor security state across the entire company.
- Reduce risk by improving security posture and reducing attack surfaces.
- Continuously detect, investigate, and respond to cybersecurity threats. 


## Portal services

The Defender portal combines a number of Microsoft security services in a single location.

**[Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/defender-xdr/microsoft-365-security-center-defender-cloud)** | Defender for Cloud improves multicloud and on-premises security posture, and protect cloud workloads against security threats. It integrates into the Defender portal so that security teams can access Defender for Cloud alerts in the portal, providing a single location with added rich context for security investigations.

> [!NOTE]
> When you open the portal, you see only the security services included in your subscriptions. For example, if you have Defender for Office 365 but not Defender for Endpoint, you see features and capabilities for Defender for Office 365, but not for device protection.

## Portal permissions

Access to the Defender portal is configured with Microsoft Entra global roles, or using custom roles.

For Microsoft Sentinel, after you connect Microsoft Sentinel to the Defender portal, your existing Azure role-based access control (RBAC) permissions allow you to work with the Microsoft Sentinel features that you have access to. Continue to manage roles and permissions for your Microsoft Sentinel users from the Azure portal. Any Azure RBAC changes are reflected in the Defender portal.

## Working with the portal

The Defender portal helps you to investigate and respond to attacks by bringing in signals from different workloads into a set of unified experiences for:

- Incidents & alerts
- Hunting
- Actions & submissions
- Threat analytics
- Secure score
- Trials
- Partner catalog


## Quickly view your environment

The **Home** page shows many of the common cards that security teams need. The composition of cards and data is dependent on the user role. Because the Defender portal uses role-based access control, different roles see cards that are more meaningful to their day to day jobs.

This at-a-glance information helps you keep up with the latest activities in your organization. Microsoft Defender XDR brings together signals from different sources to present a holistic view of your Microsoft 365 environment.

You can add and remove different cards depending on your needs.

## Get notifications

Notifications are messages that inform you about important events or updates in the Defender portal. They help you stay on top of your security tasks and alerts.

:::image type="content" source="/defender/media/microsoft-365-defender-portal/notifications-panel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the notifications icon in the Microsoft Defender portal." lightbox="/defender/media/microsoft-365-defender-portal/notifications-panel.png":::

Notifications are in the top bar of the portal's user interface. You can access them by clicking on the notification icon, which looks like a bell. A number on the icon indicates that you have that number of unread notifications.

Notifications can tell you about various types of events or updates:

- Success: when an action or task has been completed successfully like scanning a device or applying a policy.
- Ongoing: when an action is in progress.
- Information: when there is some information that you might find useful.
- Warning: when there is a potential issue or risk that you should be aware of like a device that is out of compliance or a policy that needs to be updated.
- Error: when there is an error or failure that requires your attention like an incident is deleted or merged, a scan that failed, or a policy that could not be applied.

Each notification has a title and content that provides relevant information about the event or update. Each notification also has a timestamp that shows when the notification was generated.

You can hide notifications from your view. You can dismiss a single notification by clicking on the *x* icon on the right side of the notification. You can also dismiss all notifications in the list with a single click by using *dismiss all* at the top of the notification panel.

Dismissing a notification does not delete it from the portal. You can always view your dismissed notifications by selecting  *show dismissed* at the bottom of the notification panel.

Notifications are sorted by their generated time in the notification panel, with the most recent ones displayed first. You can scroll through the list of notifications to see older ones.


## Get reports

In the portal, you can start with a general security report, and branch into specific reports about endpoints, email & collaboration. The links are dynamically generated based upon workload configuration.
