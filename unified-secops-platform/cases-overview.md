# Manage cases natively in Microsoft's unified security operations (SecOps) platform

Collaborate and investigate in Microsoft's unified SecOps platform with builtin case management. The Case Management Starter Kit (CMSK) is the end-to-end solution that provides seamless management of security alerts, incidents and investigations. Maintain security context and work all the jobs to be done more efficiently.

## Plan for cases

The CSMK is available in the Defender portal for all Microsoft Sentinel customers that have onboarded to the unified SecOps platform. For more information on connecting a Microsoft Sentinel workspace, see [Microsoft Sentinel in the Defender portal](/azure/sentinel/microsoft-sentinel-defender-portal).
